Low Voltage Conductor Breakage Detector using IoT and Edge AI
Overview
This project presents a cost-effective and intelligent solution for detecting breakages in Low Voltage AC Distribution Over Head conductors. It leverages a combination of IoT hardware and an on-device AI model to provide real-time anomaly detection, ensuring a swift and automated response to potential faults.

The system continuously monitors current and voltage, using a lightweight machine learning model deployed on an ESP32 microcontroller to identify deviations from normal operating conditions. Upon detecting a fault, it automatically isolates the power supply, activates a local buzzer alarm, and sends an SMS alert to concerned authorities.

Key Features
Real-time Monitoring: Continuous sensing of current and voltage parameters.
Edge AI: Anomaly detection is performed on the device (ESP32) using a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model, eliminating the need for constant cloud connectivity.
Automated Response: The system triggers a relay to cut power and activates an audible alarm (buzzer).
GSM/SMS Alerting: Utilizes a SIM800L module to send an immediate text message to alert personnel, ensuring a rapid response.
Cost-Effective: Utilizes widely available and low-cost components.

Methodology
1. Data Sensing & Collection
Current and voltage are measured continuously from the overhead conductor lines using the ACS712 and ZMPT101B sensors.

2. AI Model Training (Anomaly Detection)
An Autoencoder model was trained on a dataset of "normal" current readings. This model learns to compress and reconstruct the data. The reconstruction error serves as the primary metric for anomaly detection:

A low reconstruction error indicates a normal state.
A high reconstruction error (above a predefined threshold) signals an anomaly or a potential fault.
The training process was conducted in Python using pandas, scikit-learn, and tensorflow. The model was then converted to a highly optimized TensorFlow Lite (.tflite) format for deployment on the ESP32.

3. On-Device Inference & Alerting
The converted .tflite model, compiled into a C-extension (.h file), is integrated into the ESP32's firmware. The microcontroller:

Takes sensor readings.
Feeds the scaled data into the AI model.
Calculates the reconstruction error.
Compares the error against the pre-calibrated threshold.
If the error exceeds the threshold or the voltage drops below a safe level, a fault is declared.
The relay is triggered to cut the power, the buzzer is activated, and an SMS message is sent via the SIM800L module to notify the relevant personnel.
Code and Implementation
AI Model Training (Python)
The train_model.py script contains the full pipeline for training the Autoencoder and converting it to a TensorFlow Lite model.

Embedded C++ Code (Arduino)
The main.ino file contains the complete firmware for the ESP32, including the sensor reading logic, AI model inference, and the fault-handling routines with the integrated SIM800L code. The model_data.h file contains the binary data of the converted TFLite model.

Installation and Setup
Hardware Assembly: Connect the components, including the SIM800L module, as per the circuit diagram.
Arduino IDE Setup: Install the ESP32 board manager and required libraries.
Model Conversion: Run the Python script to generate model_data.h.
Upload Code: Upload the main.ino and model_data.h files to your ESP32.
